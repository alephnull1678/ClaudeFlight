# ClaudeFlight

Three.js low-poly flight simulator attempt, made entirely using Claude Code.


## Introduction

This web application was created as part of a experiment to learn more about Claude Code - specifically in the way it reacts to different levels of interactions from the prompter.

I started with a simple and vague prompt:
*"create a low-poly flight simulator web app"*

The end result was still fairly impressive for a one-shot prompt - this demo can be found in the **OneShot** folder.

Afterwards, I wrote a long, more complex set of instructions (found in *instructions.md*) and iterated on the end result in ~30 messages. The end result can be found in the **Planned** folder and can be played [here](https://alephnull1678.github.io/ClaudeFlight/).
